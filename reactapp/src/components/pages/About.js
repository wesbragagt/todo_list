                Hi, this is a Todo list app, dedicated towards musicians that
                have to learn and practice a lot of material for professional
                performances. Just add the artist name and song and we will keep
                track of it, remember to check the ones completed when you are
                done practicing each song.
            </p>
        </React.Fragment>
    );
